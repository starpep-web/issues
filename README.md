# StarPep Web - Issue Tracker and Discussions

To make bug reporting easier we decided to create this repository to keep track of any reports regarding the usage of the application. Since the application is separated into multiple services, most people that may find bugs will most likely not know what service the bug is located in. For this reason, any reports, feature requests, discussions, and communications will be done in this repository.
